# Mission-to-Mars

## Resources
    - Software Platform: Python 3.7.6, conda 4.8.3, Visual Studio Code 1.47.2, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3, Google Chrome 

### Challenge Objective
In this weeks challenge, we were tasked with adding high definition images of mars hemispheres to our mars html page. This was done by finding the image links using google chrome and web scraping. The scraping.py, flask app.py, and html templates were updated in order to reflect new links to the four hemisphere images. The code can be found in the attached files and a screenshot of the updated web page can be viewed below. Clicking each hemisphere name brings you to a new page with the high definition image displayed.
